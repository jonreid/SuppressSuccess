<p align="center"><em>Noise-free by design.</em></p>

<p align="center">A CLI that suppresses output on success. On failure, it prints the full output for debugging and returns the original exit code.</p>

[![Build](https://github.com/isidore/SuppressSuccess/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/isidore/SuppressSuccess/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Why 
Too often we pollute AI with reams of output from our builds.
While this is needed to debug failures, it is clutter when the build passes.
suppress_success is an easy way to get the best of both.

## Quick start

```bash
suppress_success echo "Hello"                    # prints "Success"
suppress_success --message "Hi" echo "Hello"     # prints "Hi"
suppress_success sh -c 'echo "Hello" && exit 1'  # prints "Hello", exits 1
```
